#NLS (National Language System) array.

#The basic idea and values was taken from then Horde Framework (http://horde.org)
#The original filename was horde/config/nls.php.
#The modifications to fit it for Gallery were made by Jens Tkotz
#(http://gallery.meanalto.com) 

#Ideas from Gallery's implementation made to CMS by Ted Kulp

#Native language name
$nls['language']['fa_IR'] = '%Gفارسي%@';
$nls['englishlang']['fa_IR'] = 'Farsi';

#Possible aliases for language
$nls['alias']['fa'] = 'fa_IR';
$nls['alias']['farsi'] = 'fa_IR' ;
$nls['alias']['fa_IR.UTF-8'] = 'fa_IR' ;

#Encoding of the language
$nls['encoding']['fa_IR'] = 'UTF-8';

#Location of the file(s)
$nls['file']['fa_IR'] = array(dirname(__FILE__).'/fa_IR/admin.inc.php');

#Language setting for HTML area
# Only change this when translations exist in HTMLarea and plugin dirs
# (please send language files to HTMLarea development)

$nls['htmlarea']['fa_IR'] = 'ja';
