#NLS (National Language System) array.

#The basic idea and values was taken from then Horde Framework (http://horde.org)
#The original filename was horde/config/nls.php.
#The modifications to fit it for Gallery were made by Jens Tkotz
#(http://gallery.meanalto.com)

$nls['alias']['fr_CA'] = 'fr_FR' ;
$nls['alias']['fr_LU'] = 'fr_FR' ;
$nls['alias']['fr_CH'] = 'fr_FR' ;
$nls['alias']['fr_FR.ISO8859-1'] = 'fr_FR' ;

#Encoding of the language

#Location of the file(s)
