#The basic idea and values was taken from then Horde Framework (http://horde.org)
#The original filename was horde/config/nls.php.
#The modifications to fit it for Gallery were made by Jens Tkotz
#(http://gallery.meanalto.com)

#Possible aliases for language

$nls['alias']['kazak'] = 'kz_KZ' ;
$nls['alias']['kazakh'] = 'kz_KZ' ;

#Encoding of the language
$nls['encoding']['kz_KZ'] = 'UTF-8';

#Location of the file(s)
