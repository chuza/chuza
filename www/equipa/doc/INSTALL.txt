Requirements:
    PHP 4.3+ 
    MySQL
    Apache webserver (or another php enabled webserver)

1.  Untar the source package to document root dir or your webserver
    * Your web host may not grant shell access, and you may be required
      to untar the source package to your local desktop and use another
      method (such as FTP) to transfer the files to your web servers
      document root.
    - cd DOCUMENT_ROOT
    - tar zxvf cms-VERSION.tar.gz

2.  create an empty config.php file and make it writable by your webserver's user:
    - touch config.php
    - chmod 666 config.php 

3.  Create the cms database and grant a user rights to use it:
    * Your web host may have different instructions for creating mysql databases
      and database users.
    - login to mysql: mysql -u root -p
    - create database cms;
    - grant all privileges on cms.* to cms_user@localhost identified by 'cms_pass';
      (optional, if you want to make sure character encodings are correct -- we'll
       try to set this on installation, but it doesn't work):
            - ALTER DATABASE cms DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    - quit

4.  Fix the permissions on the cache and template compilation directories so the web 
    server has access to them.
    - chmod -R 777 tmp
    - chmod -R 777 uploads
      optionally, if you would like to be able to install modules via the admin panel:
      - chmod -R 777 modules

5.  Open up your new CMS site in your webbrowser and you will be guided through a short install.
    - Be sure to run the file creation mask tests
    - Be sure to check the uploaded files for errors using the checksum file matching
      the package you downloaded.  The checksum file is available from the same location as the
      software package.

6.  After install, for security sake, you should set your config.php back to a read-only state.
    - chmod 444 config.php

7.  To reach your sites administration console, point your browser to: http://yoursiteurl/admin/

Admin features including user management, template management, section management, and of course content management can all be accessed at your CMSROOT/admin.

Optional: 

8.  Some setup parameters are set to a default value and are not editable through the webinterface.
    Although CMS works out-of-the-box, you might still want to edit these parameters
    - open the config.php file with you favorite editor (this file has been created by the installer)
  
      Some of the parameters you can find here are:
      The image manipulation library used by the Image manager, either 'GD' or 'NetPBM' or 
      'IM' for ImageMagick. 
      - $config["image_manipulation_prog"] = "GD";        

      If the library is NetPBM or IM, you need to specify where the binary for the selected library are.
      -  $config["image_transform_lib_path"] = "/usr/bin/ImageMagick/";
 
      The location (filepath and URL) to which files are uploaded using the filemanager
      - $config["uploads_path"] = "/site/web/cms/uploads";
      - $config["uploads_url"] = "http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/cms/uploads";

      The location (filepath and URL) to which files are uploaded using the imagemanager. 
      This can be the same path as the image manager URL.
      - $config["image_uploads_path"] = "/site/web/cms/uploads/images";
      - $config["image_uploads_url"] = "http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/cms/uploads/images";
