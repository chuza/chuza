1.  Do a complete verified backup of your installation before overwriting any
    files, this MUST include a database backup.

2.  Untar the source package to document root dir or your webserver
      - cd DOCUMENT_ROOT
      - tar xvfz cmsmadesimple-VERSION.tar.gz
OR
      - cd DOCUMENT_ROOT
      - tar xvfz cmsmadesimple-diff-<prev_version>-<version>.tar.gz
      ** Validate that the prev_version number matches your current version **

3.  Copy all of the files over top of your existing installation

4.  Upgrade needs write access to your config.php file.  This is only until 
    the upgrade is complete.
	- chmod 666 config.php

5.  Point your browser to the install/upgrade.php page to be guided through 
    the upgrade procedure.  Some releases may not have to do any upgrades, so 
    if it  says that it's up to date, don't panic.

6.  After the upgrade is complete, for security sake, you should set your 
    config.php back to a read-only state.
        - chmod 444 config.php

7.  Check your Module Management page to make sure there are no modules that 
    need an upgrade.  If they do, please click the Upgrade link next to each 
    of them.

8.  Check your Module Management page for modules that may be incompatible
    with your new version of CMS Made Simple and upgrade these modules through
    the module manager.
