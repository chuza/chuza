INSTALLATION NOTES
====================================================

PHP Enabled Webserver
---------------------
1. Upload the following to a webserver which is PHP
   enabled, changing the values in index.html to 
   reflect the location of your webserver, and
   in javaUpload.php to reflect where on the 
   webserver the files are to be uploaded to.
	- index.html
	- javaUpload.php
	- Postlet.jar
2. Browse to the location of index.html, and all 
   being well, you should be given an option to 
   accept a certificate (signed by myself), you
   should accept this for testing purposes.
   Ideally, the applet should be signed by Verisign
   or similar.
3. If prefered, you can sign the JAR file yourself,
   instructions will be on 
   http://postlet.sourceforge.net shortly.
   
Alternative Webserver
---------------------
I currently only have a script suitable for the 
upload of files to a php enabled server.  If anyone 
would like to write one for ASP or similar, please
feel free to, and email me the results.
